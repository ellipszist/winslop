This started as a joke.
Then Microsoft said “slop vs sophistication” out loud and it stopped being one.
If this tool needs marketing, it probably shouldnt exist 😆


To be clear:  
**Windows is not bad.**  
Don’t get me wrong.

**The slop is.**
Winslop does exactly what the name suggests:
- removes slop  
- reduces slop  
- makes slop visible  
- gives control back to the user  

Winslop is what happens when you take that idea seriously.
Not anti-Windows, not anti-AI, just anti-slop.

It removes the unnecessary stuff, tones down the rest and shows you exactly what’s going on.
No cloud, no assistants, no magic.
Everything is local, deterministic and reversible.

**Under the hood this is a very small, very focused fork of my earlier project [CrapFixer](https://github.com/builtbybel/CrapFixer)**.
Localization never really happened there.
Winslop will likely get it soon, mostly because the codebase is drastically smaller.
Nothing fancy. Just tools.

## FAQ
<sub>Click to expand. No assistant required.</sub>

<details>
<summary><strong>Is Winslop anti-Windows?</strong></summary>

No.  
Windows itself is fine.  
The unnecessary stuff layered on top of it isn’t.

Winslop targets **slop**, not Windows.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Is this an anti-AI project?</strong></summary>

Also no.

Winslop doesn’t care whether something is AI, scripted, cloud-based or hand-written.  
If it’s forced, opaque, or unnecessary, its slop.

If it’s optional, transparent and useful, it’s fine.
</details>


<details>
<summary><strong>Does Winslop use AI?</strong></summary>

No.

There is no model, no prompt, no inference step.  
Everything is deterministic and based on explicit user choices.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Is anything uploaded to the cloud?</strong></summary>

No.

Winslop does not upload logs, telemetry, system data or usage statistics.  
All actions happen locally on your machine.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Can Winslop break my system?</strong></summary>

Any system tool can if misused.

That’s why Winslop:
- shows exactly what it will change  
- never runs anything automatically  
- allows changes to be reviewed and reverted  

You stay in control.
</details>


<details>
<summary><strong>Why not just use Copilot / Settings / PowerShell?</strong></summary>

You can.

Winslop exists for people who prefer:
- fewer layers  
- less abstraction  
- no opinions  
- no assistants  

Just tools.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Is this related to CrapFixer?</strong></summary>

Yes.

Winslop is a very small, focused fork of CrapFixer.  
The goal was to remove complexity, reduce scope and make things easier to maintain.

Smaller codebase.  
Clearer intent.  
Less slop.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Why the name?</strong></summary>

Because Microsoft said *“slop vs sophistication”* out loud.

And because Windows isn’t bad.  
The slop is.
