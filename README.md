This started as a joke.
Then Microsoft said “slop vs sophistication” out loud and it stopped being one.
If this tool needs marketing, it probably shouldnt exist 😆


To be clear:  
**Windows is not bad.**  
I actually like it.

**But the direction of Windows 11 is.**  
And I probably hate it more than I'm willing to admit.
So I shipped this again. Cheaper than therapy. Comes with toggles.

**The slop is.**
Winslop does exactly what the name suggests:
- removes slop  
- reduces slop  
- makes slop visible  
- gives control back to the user  

Winslop is what happens when you take that idea seriously.
Not anti-Windows, not anti-AI, just anti-slop.

It removes the unnecessary stuff, tones down the rest and shows you exactly what’s going on.
No cloud, no assistants, no magic.
Everything is local, deterministic and reversible.

**Under the hood this is a very small, very focused fork of my earlier project [CrapFixer](https://github.com/builtbybel/CrapFixer)**.
Localization never really happened there.
Winslop will likely get it soon, mostly because the codebase is drastically smaller.
Nothing fancy. Just tools.

## FAQ
<sub>Click to expand. No assistant required.</sub>

<details>
<summary><strong>Is Winslop anti-Windows?</strong></summary>

No.  
Windows itself is fine.  
The unnecessary stuff layered on top of it isn’t.

Winslop targets **slop**, not Windows.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Is this an anti-AI project?</strong></summary>

Also no.

Winslop doesn’t care whether something is AI, scripted, cloud-based or hand-written.  
If it’s forced, opaque, or unnecessary, its slop.

If it’s optional, transparent and useful, it’s fine.
</details>


<details>
<summary><strong>Does Winslop use AI?</strong></summary>

No.

There is no model, no prompt, no inference step.  
Everything is deterministic and based on explicit user choices.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Is anything uploaded to the cloud?</strong></summary>

No.

Winslop does not upload logs, telemetry, system data or usage statistics.  
All actions happen locally on your machine.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Can Winslop break my system?</strong></summary>

Any system tool can if misused.

That’s why Winslop:
- shows exactly what it will change  
- never runs anything automatically  
- allows changes to be reviewed and reverted  

You stay in control.
</details>


<details>
<summary><strong>Why not just use Copilot / Settings / PowerShell?</strong></summary>

You can.

Winslop exists for people who prefer:
- fewer layers  
- less abstraction  
- no opinions  
- no assistants  

Just tools.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Is this related to CrapFixer?</strong></summary>

Yes.

Winslop is a very small, focused fork of CrapFixer.  
The goal was to remove complexity, reduce scope and make things easier to maintain.

Smaller codebase.  
Clearer intent.  
Less slop.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Why the name?</strong></summary>

Because Microsoft said *“slop vs sophistication”* out loud.

And because Windows isn't bad.  
The slop is.

Winslop is **anti-slop by design**.

That’s why the UI is intentionally small, plain and functional.
No glossy visuals.  
No animations.  
No AI-generated fluff.

Slop comes in many forms:
- **AI slop** > mass-produced, soulless output
- **Feature slop** > unnecessary features that make UX worse
- **UX / Design slop** > bloated, unclear interfaces
- **Corporate slop** > buzzwords, filler and dark patterns

Winslop does the opposite:
It removes more than it adds.

<details>
<summary><strong>Confession: I like Windows, but...</strong></summary>

I just hate what Windows 11 keeps trying to become.  
So I built the “stop doing that” button again.  
Consider this stress relief with a UI.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>What is Winslop written in?</strong></summary>
Started in C, then I forked CrapFixer and finished it in C# and continued from there, just much smaller and more focused.
no glossy modern UI stack. No WinUI. No Mica. No overdesigned "modern Windows app" look. No "look how fancy we are" .
Just tools.
